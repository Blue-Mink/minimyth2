# MiniMyth2



## What it is
MiniMyth2 is dedicated firmware designed to turnaround small-factor ARMv7, ARMv8, i386 and x86_64 small-factor
computers into MythTV appliance offering fully functional MythTV frontend.

For platforms supporting PXE boot - MiniMyth2 offers disk-less, zero-effort provisioned, network booted MythTV frontend appliance.

From the software perspective, MiniMyth2 is MythTV frontend with minimal required run-time
(Linux kernel, GNU libraries, video/audio/IR remote drivers) allowing to run MythTV frontend with full speed & features
on recent hardware from Intel/AMD/Amlogic/Rockchip/Allwinner/Raspbery.

Comparing MiniMyth2 with other distributions, MiniMyth2 is closest to buildroot - with difference MiniMyth2 uses canadian
cross cross-compilation. In MiniMyth2 issuing make build command automates:
- downloading sources
- building build enviroment for building cross-toolchain
- building cross-toolchain
- building target binaries with cross-toolchain
- preparing bootable image
- uploading created bootable image to i.e. PXE server or NFS server or starts flashing SD card

From building perspective - MiniMyth2 is closest to LFS build in fully automated way.

When compared to i.e. LibreELEC - MiniMyth2 builds single universal rootfs image for all supported boards.
Difference beetween SD card images for each supported board is only in bootloader (SD card BOOT partition).
It also offers multi-board capability so teoretically it can build - in one build session - single SD card
image for all SoC. Practically - due some SoC boot procedure conflicts/bootloader SoC speciffic overlaps -
only subset of SoC can work with universal card SD image currently.



## Project Goals
Major goals of project are:

- Make MythTV frontend zero-effort setup/deployment.
Setup of MythTV frontend might be as simple as burning SD card or enabling PXE boot in frontendâ€™s BIOS/EFI.

- Make graphics/sound/IR remote detection/configuration fully automatic.
No any drivers install nor configuration is required for any from 1500+ of graphic supported. The same for audio and IR remotes.

- Make easy adoption of recent FOSS achievements as base for creating zero-effort provisioned out-of-box ready to use
dedicated MythTV appliance.
Project is exploiting developments in GNU/Linux area like:
  - mainline Linux kernel support for Amlogic/Rockchip/Allwinner/Raspbery SoCs
  - Mesa3D Panfrost/Lima as FOSS support for ARM 3D IP
  - stateless/stateful V4L2 Video decode (Amlogic VDEC, Rockchip HANTRO/RKVDEC and Allwinner CEDRUS)
  - in-kernel IR remote decode for covering wide variety of supported IR remotes



## What it is not
MiniMyth2 is not just another Linux distro which is
designed to install on PC hardware and to used as computer
running various software.
Target scenario with MiniMyth2 is small, disk-less dedicated appliance
running MythTV Frontend (and practically only MythTV Frontend).

### Hardware Video Decode support
This is video related functionality avaliable on current code (Linux kernel + Mesa + MythTV)
At the moment quality of playback is good for technology preview. 
On platforms with statefull v4l2_m2m video codecs (Amlogic/RPI3/RPI4 H.264) playback seek works not fully smooth (but it is generally usable).
