Release Notes:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v10.0.0
-------
This version has chaged strategy regarding default settings. Now MM2 settings
defaults are following minimal enabled model. This is because we want
to have highest probability to get working system with minimal effort and issues
on PXE booted systems and on locally booted SD card systems.
Following settings are changed:
MM_ACPI_EVENT_BUTTON_POWER from 'off' to 'sleep'
MM_CPU_USERSPACE_GOV_PARAMS from <empty> to '-m 3 -p 200 -u 50 -l 15'
MM_AUDIO_RECON_DISP_FOR_RELOAD_ELD from <empty> to 'no'
MM_AUDIO_FETCH_ASOUND_CONF from <empty> to 'no'
MM_AUDIO_FETCH_ASOUND_STATE from <empty> to 'no'
MM_MYTHTV_RUN_ON_EGLFS from <empty> to 'no'
MM_MAIL_NOTIFY_NEW_MAILS from <empty> to 'no'
MM_THEME_NAME from 'Default' to =''
MM_THEME_URL from 'auto' to =''
MM_THEMECACHE_URL from 'auto' to ''
MM_LIRC_FETCH_EVMAP_CONF from <empty> to 'no'
MM_SSH_SERVER_ENABLED from <empty> to 'no'
MM_OPTICAL_RIP_ENABLED from <empty> to ='no'
MM_VOIP_ENABLED from <empty> to ='no'
MM_VOIP_LOAD_CONFIG from <empty> to ='no'
MM_RESTART_ON_SLEEP from 'mythfrontend' to 'none'


v9.0.0
-------
This version has updated qt5 and qt WebKit to better support WEB browsing.
This unfortunatelly increases image size to over 216M.
Pls remember to chage to ramdisk_size=226000 when You are using PXE boot
with RAMDISK root FS



v8.18.0
-------
This version has updated llvm and mesa components to better support newest
AMD graphic cards. This unfortunatelly increases image size to over 202M.
Pls remember to chage to ramdisk_size=208000 when You are using PXE boot 
with RAMDISK root FS



v8.15.6
-------
This version has updated current AMD firmware files so image size increases
over 192M.
Pls remember to chage to ramdisk_size=196000 when You are using PXE boot 
with RAMDISK root FS



v8.15.1
-------
This version has enabled real time threads support for mythfrontend.
Unfortunatelly enabling RT threads makes mythfrontend
(as of current master @29/12/2017) unstable (deadlocks; system freezes).
If You are expieriencing such issues - pls disable real-time threads in 
MythTV/Settings/Playback/General



v8.13.4
-------
This version has changed path what is shared as remotecache. This version
changes this from /home/minimyth/.mythtv/cache/remotecache to
/home/minimyth/.mythtv/cache
Also this version autimatically adds hostname suffix to MM_REMOTECACHE_URL.
This allows to have thesame MM_REMOTECACHE_URL for all frontends as every
frontend will have now its dedicated subdir <hostname>



v8.13.2
-------
This version has changed path where MythTV mounts Bluray disk. Now it is 
always '/media/disk' instead '/media/sr0'. Pls remember to change BluRay
path to '/media/disk' in MythTV setings - otherwise BluRay playback will
not work after upgrade to v8.13.2



v8.13.0
-------
This version has build-in current AND legacy Nvidia drivers. Nice thing is
that now MM2 supports ALL nvidia cards supported by propietary Nvidia drivers
(current + legacy 340.xx). When there is HW supported by both drivers - MM2
gives precedense for current drivers. It is possible however to ask MM2 to force
to use legacy drivers by adding in minimyth.conf MM_X_HW_TYPE='nvidia_legacy'

NOTE: MM2 image has increased size to 191M so pls remember to chage 
to ramdisk_size=192000 when You are using PXE boot with RAMDISK root FS.



v8.11.0
-------
This verssion has changed strategy for VideoPlaybackProfile handling. 
Now - if MM_VIDEO_PLAYBACK_PROFILE is empty (and this is default) - at first run,
mm2 will set VideoPlaybackProfile to build-in profile best matching detected HW.
At next runs will mm2 not touch VideoPlaybackProfile anymore.
This allows to have first run of mm2 with ful plug-and-play while also preserving
any future user changes in video playback profile.
This version of mm2 has also removed auto-generation of 'MiniMyth' VideoPlaybackProfile.
It brings no value today while requires patching of mythtv sources and makes boot process longer.
By this MM_VIDEO_DECODER and MM_VIDEO_DEINTERLACER variables are removed as they 
are no more used/valid.
For more details - pls look at build in HTML documentation.

NOTE: First mm2 run detection is based on checking JUMP MAINMENU jumppoint.
If it is set to 'Alt+H' (mm2 defaults this jumppoint to Alt+H by mm2 lirc subsystem) -
mm2 assumes it is NOT first run.


v8.10.0
-------
This version moves LIRC to devinput by default. Benefit is to support out-of-box
hot-pluging for all IR remotes supported by kernel. Build-in lircd.conf and lircrc
files have name space synchronized with devinput. 
If You wanto to have lirc working in old way (lircd decode) - you need to add
MM_LIRC_USE_DEVINUT='no' in minimyth.conf
There are reports that for streamzap remotes, in-kernel decode has issue with keys
repeats. In such case it is advisable to switch to old way (lircd decode) by adding
MM_LIRC_USE_DEVINUT='no' in minimyth.conf


v8.9.0
------
This version has updated lirc from 5y old 0.9.0 to current 0.10.0. If You will notice
any issues with lirc - pls make sure Your lirc configuration files are OK for lirc 0.10.


General comments:
-----------------
-MiniMyth2 is compiled for generic 64bit arch so size of image is bigger by 20-25% only by this.
Increased size of image requires bigger RAM disk. ramdisk_size=172000 in kernel boot
parameters will be OK.

-This release includes full, HW accelerated graphic stacks for Nvidia/Radeon/Intel/VMware.

-MiniMyth2 runs on RAM disk - so for heavy themes (like MythMediaStream or MythAeon) and 
monitor/display set to HD, 2G of RAM might be not enough (especially when You have 512M allocated
as shared Video RAM). 3G of RAM is perfectly enough.

-MiniMyth2, compared to Minimyth, expects different locations for conf and conf-rw directories.
Both directories should be on the same location as bootloader (gpxe.0/ipxe.0/pxelinux.0) file.

-Splash screen support under VMware requires dedicated video mode. vga=0x33f needs to
be added to kernel boot parameters in Default file.
