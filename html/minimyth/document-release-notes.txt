Release Notes:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v8.10.0
-------
This version moves LIRC to devinput by default. Benefit is to support out-of-box
hot-pluging for all IR remotes supported by kernel. Build-in lircd.conf and lircrc
files have name space synchronized with devinput. 
If You wanto to have lirc working in old way (lircd daemon) - you need to add
MM_LIRC_USE_DEVINUT='no' in minimyth.conf


v8.9.0
------
This version has updated lirc from 5y old 0.9.0 to current 0.10.0. If You will notice
any issues with lirc - pls make sure Your lirc configuration files are OK for lirc 0.10.


General comments:
-----------------
-Minimyth2 is compiled for generic 64bit arch so size of image is bigger by 20-25% only by this.
Increased size of image requires bigger RAM disk. ramdisk_size=172000 in kernel boot
parameters will be OK.

-This release includes full, HW accelerated graphic stacks for Nvidia/Radeon/Intel/VMware.

-Minimyth2 runs on RAM disk - so for heavy themes (like MythMediaStream or MythAeon) and 
monitor/display set to HD, 2G of RAM might be not enough (especially when You have 512M allocated
as shared Video RAM). 3G of RAM is perfectly enough.

-Minimyth2, compared to Minimyth, expects different locations for conf and conf-rw directories.
Both directories should be on the same location as bootloader (gpxe.0/ipxe.0/pxelinux.0) file.

-Splash screen support under VMware requires dedicated video mode. vga=0x33f needs to
be added to kernel boot parameters in Default file.
