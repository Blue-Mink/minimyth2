Release Notes:
v12.7.0


All platforms:
--------------
-This ver. has changed default theme from Myth Center to Monochrome.
Monochrome is IMHO much better looking & modern theme, so I hope this
will improve first boot impressi0n of MiniMyth2

-video mode switching on DRM rendering works ok for refresh rate changing - but
 not for resolution changing. By this - when you are enabling UseVideoModes -
 make sure you set "Display Video with GUI resolution".


All Nvidia platforms (ION/ION2/etc):
------------------------------------
- v12.7.0 is switching from propietray Nvidia drivers to nuoveau/Mesa FOSS drivers.
- video HW accell. decoding in EGLFS is not supported yet by nuoveau/Mesa


Intel N3450 devices: (i.e. MELE PCG03, Beelink T34, Beelink M1, etc)
-------------------
-legacy framebufer seems to be broken - so bootsplash screen is distorted &
 frozen at boot. Device boots however OK - so pls don't be missleaded by frozen
 bootsplash :-)
-some devices have broken BIOS - so if you plan to use suspend-resume with 
 external, USB attached IR dongle (i.e. MCE USB IR) - pls add appropriate
 entry in minimyth.conf:
 IR attached to closer to front usb port on right side of box
 MM_LIRC_WAKEUP_ENABLED="/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:15.0/usb1/1-3/power/wakeup"
 IR attached closer to back usb port on right side of box
 MM_LIRC_WAKEUP_ENABLED="/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:15.0/usb1/1-4/power/wakeup"
 IR attached closer to front usb port on left side of box
 MM_LIRC_WAKEUP_ENABLED="/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:15.0/usb1/1-2/power/wakeup"
 IR attached closer to back usb port on left side of box
 MM_LIRC_WAKEUP_ENABLED="/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:15.0/usb1/1-1/power/wakeup"
-Enabled CEC causing MythTV frontend segfaulting on start which is manifesting
 with black screen when MiniMyth2 boots. Only solution - so far - is to make sure
 database for this frontend has setting 'libCECEnabled' set to 0
-on some content there are reports of crashing myth frontend when user does multiple
 series of seeks. It looks it is issue casued by intel-media-driver. In such cases
 switch to older vaapi driver helps. To do this add in minimyth.conf
 MM_MYTHTV_SET_ENV_VAR="LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=i965"


Intel Z8500 devices: (i.e. Beelink BT4):
--------------------
-On Beelink BT4 device BIOS is broken in na way that USB resume from suspend-to-ram
 hangs device at resume. Wake-on-LAN works OK - so it looks like issue is related to
 USB subsystem.
-Enabled CEC causing MythTV frontend segfaulting on start which is manifesting
 with black screen when MiniMyth2 boots. Only solution - so far - is to make sure
 database for this frontend has setting 'libCECEnabled' set to 0
- mythfrontend segfaults in Wayland on this HW


Allwinner H616:
---------------
 Currently Audio support on this SoC has bug causing both left/right audio outputs
 playing audio from left audio channel. Bus is in downstream BSP kernel code and I'm
 awaiting for fix from Allwinner.


Rockchip RK3399:
----------------
- Wayland gives black screen on this HW


Amlogic s905:
-------------
- EGLFS not works due z-position issue in messon-drm driver on this HW
