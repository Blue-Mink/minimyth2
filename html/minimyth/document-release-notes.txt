Release Notes:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v8.18.0
-------
This version has updated llvm and mesa components to better support newest
AMD graphic cards. This unfortunatelly increases image size to over 202M.
Pls remember to chage to ramdisk_size=208000 when You are using PXE boot 
with RAMDISK root FS



v8.15.6
-------
This version has updated current AMD firmware files so image size increases
over 192M.
Pls remember to chage to ramdisk_size=196000 when You are using PXE boot 
with RAMDISK root FS



v8.15.1
-------
This version has enabled real time threads support for mythfrontend.
Unfortunatelly enabling RT threads makes mythfrontend
(as of current master @29/12/2017) unstable (deadlocks; system freezes).
If You are expieriencing such issues - pls disable real-time threads in 
MythTV/Settings/Playback/General



v8.13.4
-------
This version has changed path what is shared as remotecache. This version
changes this from /home/minimyth/.mythtv/cache/remotecache to
/home/minimyth/.mythtv/cache
Also this version autimatically adds hostname suffix to MM_REMOTECACHE_URL.
This allows to have thesame MM_REMOTECACHE_URL for all frontends as every
frontend will have now its dedicated subdir <hostname>



v8.13.2
-------
This version has changed path where MythTV mounts Bluray disk. Now it is 
always '/media/disk' instead '/media/sr0'. Pls remember to change BluRay
path to '/media/disk' in MythTV setings - otherwise BluRay playback will
not work after upgrade to v8.13.2



v8.13.0
-------
This version has build-in current AND legacy Nvidia drivers. Nice thing is
that now MM2 supports ALL nvidia cards supported by propietary Nvidia drivers
(current + legacy 340.xx). When there is HW supported by both drivers - MM2
gives precedense for current drivers. It is possible however to ask MM2 to force
to use legacy drivers by adding in minimyth.conf MM_X_HW_TYPE='nvidia_legacy'

NOTE: MM2 image has increased size to 191M so pls remember to chage 
to ramdisk_size=192000 when You are using PXE boot with RAMDISK root FS.



v8.11.0
-------
This verssion has changed strategy for VideoPlaybackProfile handling. 
Now - if MM_VIDEO_PLAYBACK_PROFILE is empty (and this is default) - at first run,
mm2 will set VideoPlaybackProfile to build-in profile best matching detected HW.
At next runs will mm2 not touch VideoPlaybackProfile anymore.
This allows to have first run of mm2 with ful plug-and-play while also preserving
any future user changes in video playback profile.
This version of mm2 has also removed auto-generation of 'MiniMyth' VideoPlaybackProfile.
It brings no value today while requires patching of mythtv sources and makes boot process longer.
By this MM_VIDEO_DECODER and MM_VIDEO_DEINTERLACER variables are removed as they 
are no more used/valid.
For more details - pls look at build in HTML documentation.

NOTE: First mm2 run detection is based on checking JUMP MAINMENU jumppoint.
If it is set to 'Alt+H' (mm2 defaults this jumppoint to Alt+H by mm2 lirc subsystem) -
mm2 assumes it is NOT first run.


v8.10.0
-------
This version moves LIRC to devinput by default. Benefit is to support out-of-box
hot-pluging for all IR remotes supported by kernel. Build-in lircd.conf and lircrc
files have name space synchronized with devinput. 
If You wanto to have lirc working in old way (lircd decode) - you need to add
MM_LIRC_USE_DEVINUT='no' in minimyth.conf
There are reports that for streamzap remotes, in-kernel decode has issue with keys
repeats. In such case it is advisable to switch to old way (lircd decode) by adding
MM_LIRC_USE_DEVINUT='no' in minimyth.conf


v8.9.0
------
This version has updated lirc from 5y old 0.9.0 to current 0.10.0. If You will notice
any issues with lirc - pls make sure Your lirc configuration files are OK for lirc 0.10.


General comments:
-----------------
-MiniMyth2 is compiled for generic 64bit arch so size of image is bigger by 20-25% only by this.
Increased size of image requires bigger RAM disk. ramdisk_size=172000 in kernel boot
parameters will be OK.

-This release includes full, HW accelerated graphic stacks for Nvidia/Radeon/Intel/VMware.

-MiniMyth2 runs on RAM disk - so for heavy themes (like MythMediaStream or MythAeon) and 
monitor/display set to HD, 2G of RAM might be not enough (especially when You have 512M allocated
as shared Video RAM). 3G of RAM is perfectly enough.

-MiniMyth2, compared to Minimyth, expects different locations for conf and conf-rw directories.
Both directories should be on the same location as bootloader (gpxe.0/ipxe.0/pxelinux.0) file.

-Splash screen support under VMware requires dedicated video mode. vga=0x33f needs to
be added to kernel boot parameters in Default file.
