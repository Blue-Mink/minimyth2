Release Notes:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Minimyth2 is compiled for generic 64bit arch so size of image is bigger by 20-25% only by this.
Increased size of image requires bigger RAM disk. ramdisk_size=144000 in kernel boot
parameters will be OK.

-This release includes all graphic drivers (Nvidia/Radeon/Intel/VMware). Minimyth2 runs
on RAM disk - so for heavy themes (like MythMediaStream or MythAeon) and monitor/display set to HD,
2G of RAM might be not enough (especially when You have 512M allocated as shared Video RAM).
3G of RAM is perfectly enough.

-Minimyth2, compared to Minimyth, expects different locations for conf and conf-rw directories. 
Both directories should be on the same location as bootloader (gpxe.0/ipxe.0/pxelinux.0) file.

-Splash screen support under VMware requires dedicated video mode. vga=0x33f needs to
be added to kernel boot parameters in Default file.

-AMD/ATI FOSS drivers offers framebuffer FB device only with VESA mode equal to currently
selected by KMS mode. By this, splash boot screen on AMD/ATI is disabled.
Current Minimyth2 build is compromise between propietary Nvidia (working), FOSS for Intel (working) 
and FOSS for AMD/ATI (not working).

-Intel drivers have issue with seting splash after stoping X. By this splash is not working correctly
during shutdown/reboot process on Intel platforms.

-MythTV bug #11887 is currently unresolved. As workaround, I add code from ticked #10710.
ADDTRACKSANDPLAY key binding allows to immediate playback of given track.

-This version has included all LiveTV improvements backported from current MythTV master. 
According to my expierience and many test I done, atleast applying bellows backports to MythTV backend 
allows best LiveTV expierience:

Apllying above patches to MythTV backend isn't mandatory (LiveTV will work without them) - but with
above patches user will hopefuly expierience:
  -fastest ffw/rew for recordings
  -almost seemless program transitions
  -no 2..3sec stutter when user changes LiveTV channels
  -fully working LiveTV history walking
  -no issues with wrong rewind near end of programm.
