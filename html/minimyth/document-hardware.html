            Over the years, the computer industry has created a wide range of hardware.
            To support this hardware,
            <a href="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a>
            and
            <a href="http://xorg.freedesktop.org">Xorg</a>
            include hundreds of drivers.
            These drivers take space, which is at odds with Minimyth2's goal to be small.
            In order to remain small, Minimyth2 severely limits the
            <a href="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a>
            and
            <a href="http://xorg.freedesktop.org">Xorg</a>
            drivers that it includes.
            As a result, Minimyth2 only supports a limited set of hardware.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Minimyth2 is constantly evolving.
            As I and others have had a need to run Minimyth2 on new hardware,
            we have added support for this hardware to Minimyth2.
            If you want to know whether or not hardware not listed here is supported, or
            if you want to request support for hardware not listed here,
            then
            <a href="http://minimyth2.freeforums.org">let us know</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having said that, you will be better off using hardware that is widely used by the Minimyth2 community.
            After all, Minimyth2 naturally gets better testing on this hardware.

            If you plan to use an NVIDIA chipset + AMD CPU (Central Processing Unit) based motherboard, then you have more CPU choices.
            I have found that an AMD Athlon64 3200+ (Venice core) is powerful enough to play back 1080i HDTV without any MPEG2 hardware acceleration.
            Of course, it is more than powerful enough to handle MythGallery image scaling and MythMusic visualizations.
            You may be able to use a slower CPU.
            However, an
            <a href="http://usa.asus.com/products4.aspx?l1=3&amp;l2=15&amp;l3=210&amp;model=766&amp;modelmenu=1">ASUS A8N-VM CSM</a>
            motherboard with AMD Athlon64 3200+ CPU is lower cost than a
            <a href="http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/mainboards/motherboards.jsp?motherboard_id=261">VIA EPIA SP</a>
            motherboard, so I have never been motivated to find out.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you plan to use an Intel chipset + Intel CPU (Central Processing Unit) based motherboard, then you have more CPU choices as well.
            However, I do not know what Intel CPU would be required for HDTV playback.
            In the future, when the Intel Core 2 solutions drop in price, I may get one.
            I like that the Intel graphics drivers are Open Source.

        </div>

          <div class="heading">GPU</div>
          <p>
            First, you should strongly consider using a motherboard with an integrated GPU (Graphics Processing Unit).
            Today's motherboard integrated GPUs are more than powerful enough for a Myth frontend,
            and a Myth frontend system based on a motherboard with an integrated GPU will usually be smaller and lower power
            than one based on a motherboard without an integrated GPU.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, you should strongly consider using a VIA or Intel GPU.
            These GPUs have good, actively supported, Open Source drivers, which means that driver problems will likely be fixed quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Third, if you must use a GPU that does not have good, actively supported, Open Source drivers,
            then use an NVIDIA GPU.
            They appear to have the best proprietary Linux drivers and they are the only proprietary Linux drivers supported by Minimyth2.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter which GPU you choose, make sure that it has Linux driver support.
            Just because some of a vendor's GPUs have Linux driver support does not mean that they all do.
            Some vendors drop support for older GPUs from their proprietary drivers or
            decide not to add support for newer GPUs to their proprietary drivers.
            In addition, Open Source driver development is often limited by the availability of hardware.
          </p>
          <p>
            For graphics support, Minimyth2 uses
            <a href="http://xorg.freedesktop.org">Xorg</a>
            along with the Open Source
            <a href="http://www.openchrome.org">openChrome drivers</a>
            and the proprietary
            <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html">NVIDIA drivers</a>
            drivers.
            In order to keep Minimyth2 small,
            a complete set of
            <a href="http://xorg.freedesktop.org">Xorg</a>
            drivers are not included in Minimyth2.
            As a result, many GPUs are not supported.
            However, the integrated GPUs on the supported motherboards are supported.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="sound" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Sound</div>
          <p>
            First, you should strongly consider using a motherboard with integrated sound.
            Today's motherboard integrated sound is more than sufficient for a Myth frontend,
            and a Myth frontend system based on a motherboard with integrated sound will usually be smaller and lower power
            than one based on a motherboard without integrated sound.
          </p>
          <p>
            For sound support, Minimyth2 uses the
            <a href="http://www.alsa-project.org">ALSA</a>
            drivers included in
            <a href="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a>.
            In order to keep Minimyth2 small,
            a complete set of
            <a href="http://www.alsa-project.org">ALSA</a>
            drivers are not included in Minimyth2.
            As a result, many sound cards are not supported.
            However, the integrated sound chips on the supported motherboards are supported.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="memory" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Memory</div>
          <p>
            Minimyth2 was developed to run on a diskless computer.
            As a result, except when using NFS to mount the root file system, Minimyth2 runs with its entire compressed file system resident in memory.
            In addition, even when using NFS to mount the root file system, Minimyth2 does not use a swap file.
            Therefore, Minimyth2 requires more memory than a typical Myth frontend.
          </p>
          <p>
            How much RAM you need depends on things such as video output resolution, MythTV theme and music colllection size.
            While some people have had success running Minimyth2 with 1GB of RAM, I do not recommend it.
            I would recommend at least 2GB of RAM.
            For NVIDIA chipset + AMD CPU based motherboards with video output at higher resolutions (e.g. 1280x720 and 1920x1080),
            I use 2048MB of RAM.
            Since MythTV gets larger with each release, I would err on the side of too much memory in your Minimyth2 systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is not always obvious when a problem is caused by having too little memory.
            Problems such as the GUI hanging during or after prescaling may be caused by having too little memory.
            Problems such as the GUI crashing before or after watching a recording may be caused by having too little memory.

        <div id="remote" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Remote Control Receiver</div>
          <p>
            For remote control receiver support, Minimyth2 uses
            <a href="http://www.lirc.org">LIRC</a>.
            Since people use many different remote control receivers,
            Minimyth2 includes all the
            <a href="http://www.lirc.org">LIRC</a>
            drivers, except
            drivers that require lirc_gpio (which does not work with the 2.6.23 or newer kernels) and
            drivers that require lirc_parallel (which does not work with SMP kernels).
            Therefore, if your remote control receiver is
            <a href="http://www.lirc.org/html/table.html">supported by LIRC</a>
            and does not require one of the excluded modules,
            then it should be supported by Minimyth2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, nothing is that simple.
            <a href="http://www.lirc.org">LIRC</a>
            requires an 'lircd.conf' configuration file to map the signals received
            from your remote control by your remote control receiver to remote control key names.
            In addition,
            <a href="http://www.lirc.org">LIRC</a>
            requires an 'lircrc' configuration file to map the remote control key names to
            <a href="http://www.mythtv.org">MythTV</a>,
            <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">MPlayer</a>
            and
            <a href="http://www.xinehq.de/">Xine</a>
            commands.
            Minimyth2 does not contain 'lircd.conf' and 'lircrc' configuration files for most remote control receivers and remote controls.
            However, Minimyth2 does contain a generic 'lircrc' configuration file ('/etc/lirc.d/lircrc')
            that should work (though not optimally) with any 'lircd.conf' configuration file
            that uses the
            <a href="http://arnaud.quette.free.fr/lirc/lirc-nns.html">proposed LIRC name space</a>.
            Therefore, for most remote control receivers and remote controls, you will need to provide your own 'lircd.conf' configuration file and you may need to provide your own 'lircrc' configuration files.
          </p>
          <p>
            Personally, I use a Media Center Edition remote control receiver and remote control.
            As a result, the 'lircd.conf' and 'lircrc' configuration files for this remote control receiver and remote control are included in Minimyth2.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have 'lircd.conf' and 'lircrc' configuration files for your remote control receiver and remote control
            that you would like included in Minimyth2,
            then
            <a href="http://minimyth2.freeforums.org">let us know</a>
            the remote control receiver vendor and model,
            the remote control vendor and model,

            (if you are using a remote control receiver that connects using USB)
            the output of the command 'lsusb' with the remote control receiver connected.

            <a href="http://lcdproc.sourceforge.net/docs/stable-0-5-x-user.html#drivers">LCDproc drivers</a>.
            Therefore, if your LCD or VFD is supported by
            <a href="http://www.lcdproc.org">LCDproc</a>,
            then it should be supported by Minimyth2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, nothing is that simple.
            <a href="http://www.lcdproc.org">LCDproc</a>
            requires an 'LCDd.conf' configuration file that depends on the LCD or VFD.
            While Minimyth2 does include a default 'LCDd.conf' configuration file that should work well for many LCDs and VFDs,
            Minimyth2 does not contain specific 'LCDd.conf' configuration files for most LCDs or VFDs.
            Therefore, for LCDs and VFDs for which the default 'LCDd.conf' configuration file is not sufficient
            and no specific 'LCDd.conf' configuration file is included,
            you will need to provide your own 'LCDd.conf' configuration file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Personally, I do not have an LCD or VFD since all my Minimyth2 frontends are hidden.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have an 'LCDd.conf' configuration file for your LCD or VFD
            that you would like included in Minimyth2,
            then
            <a href="http://minimyth2.freeforums.org">let us know</a>
            the LCD or VFD vendor and model,
            the 'LCDd.conf' configuration file and
            (if you are using an LCD or VFD that connects using USB)
            the output of the command 'lsusb' with the LCD or VFD connected.
