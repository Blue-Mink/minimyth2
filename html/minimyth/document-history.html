            I'm lover of Myth since 2003. My first system was based on EPIA and excellent MiniMyth distro.
            I was so immpressed by versality and compacteness of MiniMyth so at 2008 I started develop my own diskless
            system called MiniMyth2 as derivate on MiniMyth. Generally, I hate documenting so forgive me errors and 
            inconsistences.

            In 2003, Larry Matter (<a href="http://minimyth.org/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2">lmatter</a>)
            created MiniMyth.
            He wanted a small Linux distribution that would allow him to turn a diskless
            <a href="http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/mainboards/motherboards.jsp?motherboard_id=81">VIA EPIA M</a>
            motherboard into a
            <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a>
            frontend.
            He brought to life and maintained MiniMyth, the LinPVR.org site, the forum, the version control system and the bug tracking system.
            In addition, he wrote several articles and reviews that helped people with things related to MiniMyth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like so many other useful Open Source projects, MiniMyth gained a following.
            Some of those followers began to help Larry with the MiniMyth effort.
            <a href="http://minimyth.org/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">BigA</a>
            helped with the initial testing of MiniMyth 0.1.
            Jason Barto helped with the LinPVR.org site.
            <a href="http://minimyth.org/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3">BigA</a>
            set up the forum.
            <a href="http://minimyth.org/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=46">Dna</a>
            helped with the MiniMyth build system.
            Others, including
            <a href="http://minimyth.org/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=159">corwin</a>,
            <a href="http://minimyth.org/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=5">Hairlocks</a>,
            <a href="http://minimyth.org/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=157">mjhammel</a> and
            Paul Bender (<a href="http://minimyth.org/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=203">Pablo</a>)
            created their own MiniMyth versions and/or MiniMyth build systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2005, Larry and Paul began to work on Paul's GAR based MiniMyth build system together.
            With MythTV 0.17, this GAR based MiniMyth build system became the default MiniMyth build system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, the demands of Larry's real life made it difficult for him to devote very much time to MiniMyth development.
            As a result, at this time Paul is doing much of the MiniMyth development.
            As always, the MiniMyth user community continues to contribute through ideas, testing and bug fixes.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2008, Paul moved MiniMyth from LinPVR.org to
            <a href="http://minimyth.org/">minimyth.org</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since its initial creation, MiniMyth evolved to include support for additional MythTV plugins,
            <a href="document-boot.html">boot methods</a>.
            and
            <a href="document-hardware.html">computer hardware</a>
            However, in this evolution it has tried to stay true to Larry's original vision of
            a small Linux distribution for turning a diskless computer into a MythTV frontend.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2013, Piotr Oniszczuk (warpme@o2.pl) created alternative verssion of Minimyth called MiniMyth2.
            warpme decided to create separate to Minimyth project because of different project goals. Also he want to 
            avoid confusion between those two projects as MiniMyth2, compared to Minimyth, has some components removed, 
            some added and some are different. Those differences will have considerable impact on support and maintenance areas.
            From this perspective warpme thinks separation will make users life easier.
